# Phone_Pe_Pulse_Visualization_and_Exploration
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. 
The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
Process:
1. Data extraction: To extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a format that works for you, like CSV or JSON, clone the Github and use scripting to do it.

2. Data transformation: Pre-processed and altered the data using libraries like Pandas and a scripting language like Python. This could entail preparing missing numbers, cleaning the data, and formatting it so that it can be used for analysis and visualisation.
   
3. Database insertion: Connected to a MySQL database using the Python "mysql-connector-python" module, then used SQL commands to insert the converted data.

4. Creating a dashboard: Use the Python packages Streamlit and Plotly to build an engaging and eye-catching dashboard. The data may be shown on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map features, and Streamlit can be used to make an intuitive user interface with several dropdown menus so that users can choose which facts and figures to show.
   
5. Data retrieval: To connect to a MySQL database and retrieve data into a Pandas dataframe, use the "mysql-connector-python" module. To dynamically refresh the dashboard, use the data in the dataframe.

Outcome:
This project will yield a live geovisualization dashboard with interactive and aesthetically pleasing data and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
